    "# Kenya Constitution AI Agent â€“ Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Context\n",
    "The Kenyan Constitution of 2010 is a comprehensive legal document that governs the country's laws and citizens' rights. However, it is long, complex, and written in legal language that can be difficult for the general population, especially youths, to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing relevant information quickly can be challenging, making it difficult for citizens to exercise their rights or comply with legal obligations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "*Problem Statement:*  \n",
    "Citizens, especially young people, need an accessible way to understand and query the Kenyan Constitution in everyday language. Traditional legal consultation is expensive, and reading the full document is time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Objective:*  \n",
    "Develop an AI agent that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand user queries and provide relevant answers from the Constitution. The agent should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accept questions in *English and Kiswahili*.\n",
    "- Return accurate, understandable answers.\n",
    "- Quote the specific article/section from the Constitution for credibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Stakeholders:*  \n",
    "- Kenyan youths (primary users)\n",
    "- NGOs and civic education organizations\n",
    "- Government institutions promoting civic engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Impact\n",
    "- *Empowerment:* Citizens can better understand their rights and duties.\n",
    "- *Accessibility:* Reduces reliance on legal experts for basic constitutional questions.\n",
    "- *Scalability:* The system can be deployed online and integrated via API for wider use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Considerations\n",
    "- Language support (English + Kiswahili)\n",
    "- Handling legal jargon\n",
    "- Accurate referencing of articles/chapters\n",
    "- Efficient query handling for fast responses"

    " # Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the Data\n",
    "For this project, our data sources are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *English version of the Kenyan Constitution (2010)*  \n",
    "   - Source: [The Constitution of Kenya 2010 PDF](Data/The_Constitution_of_Kenya_2010.pdf)  \n",
    "   - Contains all chapters, articles, and legal provisions in English.  \n",
    "   - Needs text extraction and cleaning to convert it into a structured format for NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Kiswahili version of the Kenyan Constitution*  \n",
    "   - Source: [Kielelezo_Pantanifu_cha_Katiba_ya_Kenya.pdf](Data/Kielelezo_Pantanifu_cha_Katiba_ya_Kenya.pdf)  \n",
    "   - Same content as the English version, translated into Kiswahili.  \n",
    "   - Requires extraction, cleaning, and alignment with the English dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Purpose of Using Both Languages:*  \n",
    "- Enable the AI agent to respond to user queries in *English* or *Kiswahili*.  \n",
    "- Improve accessibility and inclusivity for all Kenyan citizens.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structure\n",
    "After preprocessing, the expected data structure is:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Article/Section | Text (English) | Text (Kiswahili) |\n",
    "|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|\n",
    "| Article 1       | Text content   | Swahili content |\n",
    "| Article 2       | Text content   | Swahili content |\n",
    "| ...             | ...            | ...             |\n",
    "\n",
    "*Notes:*  \n",
    "- Each row corresponds to an *article* or *clause*.  \n",
    "- This will allow the NLP model to retrieve relevant sections when users ask questions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Quality Considerations\n",
    "- PDFs contain headers, footers, and formatting that need cleaning.  \n",
    "- Ensure *text alignment* between English and Kiswahili versions.  \n",
    "- Maintain *article/chapter references* to allow citations in responses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "1. Extract text from PDFs into a structured format (JSON/CSV).  \n",
    "2. Clean text by removing:\n",
    "   - Page numbers\n",
    "   - Footnotes\n",
    "   - Unnecessary whitespace and formatting characters  \n",
    "3. Verify consistency between English and Kiswahili versions.  \n",
    "4. Prepare a dataset ready for:\n",
    "   - Embeddings creation\n",
    "   - NLP query retrieval\n",
